<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>Welcome to the professional page of Roland Kwolek, a passionate
embedded development expert and dedicated Cybersecurity Architect. My
journey began with a deep-rooted fascination for electronics,
particularly in digital electronics. This passion blossomed into a
career in embedded programming, with my first programming experiences in
BASIC on an Atari 65XE at the age of 7. Since then, my skill set has
expanded, from Pascal and BASIC on Atmel’s AVR (BASCOM) to advanced
proficiency in C and C++ for embedded systems.</p>
<p>My professional experience spans a wide spectrum of technologies and
systems, from programming tiny 6-pin PIC microcontrollers to managing
expansive server farms of 1,500 machines with 24-core configurations.
This diverse journey includes mastering assembler on blade clusters in
telecommunications and leveraging C++ for 8-bit CPUs with minimal
program memory.</p>
<p>In recent years, my role has transitioned into cybersecurity, where I
lead the implementation of robust security measures across our products.
Key contributions include integrating TLS 1.3 and developing
encryption-based functionalities like elliptic curve encryption,
signature generation and verification, and certificate chain validation.
As a Cybersecurity Architect, I am responsible for overseeing
architecture analysis, leading threat modeling and incident response,
and defining security tasks for development teams to fortify our systems
against evolving threats.</p>
<p>Beyond software, I engage in the design and development of embedded
systems, encompassing schematic design, PCB layout, and prototype
integration. While I once crafted PCBs myself, my focus has shifted to
prioritize security architecture, cybersecurity assessments, and guiding
development teams in secure coding practices. Linux is my operating
system of choice across all my private machines, where it serves as a
robust and flexible platform that complements my professional work in
embedded development and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>I am an individual with a relentless drive for excellence and a
continuous learning mindset. I thrive on challenges, viewing each as an
opportunity for growth and innovation. My cybersecurity skills are
evidenced by certifications, including the ISC2 Certified in
Cybersecurity (CC), Security Engineer, Jr Penetration Tester, Red
Teaming, CompTIA Pentest+, along with specialized training from
TryHackMe.</p>
<p>My curiosity extends to understanding the inner workings of
technology, an endeavor that fuels my interest in space exploration and
the unique challenges it poses to software and hardware design. My
career also includes substantial experience in Linux-based systems, from
user space applications to kernel space drivers, with a focus on
embedded Linux using Buildroot for secure and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>As I continue to grow within cybersecurity and embedded development,
I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, guided by
my unyielding curiosity, dedication to excellence, and the goal of
ensuring resilient, future-ready systems.</p>
